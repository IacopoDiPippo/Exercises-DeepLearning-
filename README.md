# Exercises-DeepLearning-
In this repository there are a few little projects regarding Fully connected neural networks and convolutional layers used for varius tasks.
In particular:
-one project for facial keypoints recognition based on FCNN,
-one project consisting on constructing a model on the MINDST dataset with only 200 labeled images, using and autoencoder
-one project with task of pixel segmentation and using transfer learning
Furthemore added sparsly some projects on dataloaders and construction of a FCNN with only numpy and pandas.
